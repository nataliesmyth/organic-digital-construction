                <p>Organic Digital was conceived by Jonathan Phillips in 2000. From his early beginnings the theater, Mr. Phillips has trained to be a master craftsman in many areas. As a proficient writer, actor, producer he’s been able to weld together many different thoughts, people and projects into a successful run of insightful productions. He holds an MFA in Dramatic Performance from the College Conservatory of Music in Cincinnati where he graduated with honors under a full scholarship.</p>

                <p>As an actor he is a founding member of the Ensemble Theatre of Cincinnati where he performed, taught and wrote for the intern company. His play MyTime, written as his final MFA performance project, was a first prize winner at The Festival of New Works in 1988. Following the success of that performance Mr. Phillips produced three national tours of this original play. Traveling a total of over 15,000 miles he was able to reach an audience that was deeply in need of this play’s message of hope and recovery.</p>
                    
                <p>Following his relocation to Los Angeles in 1989 Mr. Phillips began his employment in Hollywood with studios such as DreamWorks, Paramount, Warner Brothers, Sony and Universal pictures. He’s worked on hundreds of films like all the Shrek Features, Saving Private Ryan, American Beauty, Gladiator, Indecent Proposal, Glengarry Glen Ross and while in New Zealand for the Universal Studios, Peter Jackson’s King Kong. His work with Sony includes The Angry Bird Movies, animated Spider-man films and many others. To date, Mr. Phillips film credits number nearly 200 major motion pictures as a top International Sound Supervisor.</p>
                    
                <p>As well as continuing his work on a A-list Hollywood features, he has also written, produced, acted and edited various films for Organic Digital.</p>
                    
                <p>“I sense I have returned to my original goal; to produce new and innovative entertainment,” says Mr. Phillips. “I was trained as an actor and writer before I went to Hollywood in the late 80s. When I arrived I tried to absorb everything I could about filmmaking. I’m very fortunate to have learned from amazingly talented people on some of the very best films of our time. I was at the epicenter of the digital revolution and saw the sweeping changes that occurred in media and entertainment. And I now set my sights on developing and producing new and original work that will speak to and reach this new audience.”</p>

            <section class="section__text">
                <p>Organic Digital’s  history started with the need to create new and original projects that would not only entertain but also instruct and teach “I’ve always tried to lead the audience in through entertainment whether it be in comedy or drama. I find that the message can be conveyed in a much easier form if people are not looking for it.”

                </p>

                <p>
                    “When I was touring on the road with MyTime I heard so many people say “Do you have a copy of this on tape? I’d love to see it again and again.” So when I got back to California I produced a short video in 1996 with some help from people I was working with at Warner Brothers. They allowed me to work on the Avid edit system after business hours to cut the film. That was my first time working on my own digital project in Hollywood.”

                </p>

                <p>
                    From that project came many more. Over the years Organic Digital has produced several films that has allowed Mr. Phillips a working pallet for his craft. The Shakespeare Guy was written as a series of monologues dealing with contemporary issues in old Elizabethan language. While in an acting group in Los Angeles Jonathan began to talk about the script when suddenly he was surrounded by a group of interested actors and filmmakers. After agreeing to the idea, a film version of these monologues was born. Shot at the DreamWorks animation campus in Glendale, California it was completely acted, written and edited by Mr. Phillips.

                </p>

                <p>“I was working on a performance of Romeo and Juliet when I begin playing around with the dialogue in daily conversation. I wrote out some of the ideas and strung them together in monologues to form this film. A lot of people ask me what Shakespearean play is that from? When I have to tell them he didn’t write it. I did.”</p>

                <p>With a strong showing of the film Mr. Phillips began working on his next project. He pulled together a very talented cast for his interesting and unique film. The Connextion is a story of a 13-year-old girl who runs up is huge cell phone bill for the month. When her father takes away her phone she spirals into a dark depression forcing her family to call a Specialist. This very real drama touches many families with his humor and handling of a very serious problem. This short film features performance by Mala Powers, Hollywood Walk of Fame actress and Jonathan Phillips as the ‘Specialist’.</p>

                <p>Back to basics, Mr. Phillips is producing and performing. With a new tour of MyTime set up he is excited to revisit the character and performance of this Award winner one person play. “I find it very interesting that the dialogue in the play has not changed, it has not needed to change. All the words are exactly as they were written in 1987. And I would hope that the message would still reach the desired audience.” </p>
